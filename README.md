# Pixel Doodle

Draw in the browser by dragging your mouse over the grid. Color can be selected with the dropdown. (Select 'white' for an eraser.) Total amount of squares on canvas grid can be changed with slider; your drawing will be lost upon resize.

Created for the Etch-a-Sketch assignment in the Odin Project's Foundations path. Built with vanilla JS.
